# Blink_Counter
This project uses MediaPipe FaceMesh and OpenCV to detect and count blinks in real-time. It identifies left-eye landmarks, calculates normalized distances to detect eye closure, and registers a blink only upon a complete open-close-open cycle. Ideal for applications like drowsiness detection and human-computer interaction.
